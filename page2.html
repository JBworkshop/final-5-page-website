		On the northernmost edge of Ablathia's Spine, nestled between ageless spires of lime and granite can be found a small Hellsguard village, all but forgotten by time. However, it was not long ago that this isolated hamlet gendered countless fighters, trained to harness their inner-beasts and translate that power to unbridled savagery on the battlefield. This art was known as the Way of the Warrior, and those who followed its teachings were eagerly sought by mercenary troupes, who, in turn, were sought by the warring city-states of the era. Impressed by the warriors' prowess in combat, city-state armies soon began incorporating the ancient Hellsguard art in their training regimens, thus accelerating the proliferation of the fighting style throughout the whole of the realm. Unfortunately, as the keepers of the art passed away or were slain in battle, so too did the Way of the Warrior fade, descending once more into the shadows of obscurity, where it remains to this day.

		Warrior is a high damage dealing, self-healing tank class, wielding a battle axe, players will see themselves grabbing large groups of monsters for your fellow parties members, and protecting them with high burst damage abilties.
		This calls is relatively easy in difficulty, as it contains little advanced mechanics for one to get used to. This is a Base Game Class, which means it is available with Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn and does not require either of the expansions to unlock and play.
		This class specializes in healing itself from damage, and having the highest amount of damage out of the three available tanks. When chooisng tis class, you wills tart out in the Limnsa Laminsa City State ingame.

		<h2>So You Want To Tank?</h2>

		So, you wish to become a tank? What does one exactly do as the tank of the party? Well, as a tnak you will be doing two main things: Taking enemy aggro (which means to gain enemy attention, and hold on to them while your teammates attack them), and you lead the party, protecting your healer and contorlling the pace of your dungeon run.
		No matter what, you will always follow the priority of; protect the healer, and hold enemy aggro. Without you, the team's healer will attacked and unable to heal your party, and without your healer, you and your party cannot make it through the dungeon. If you're playing as the tank: you're the centerpiece of the group, especially in boss battle content, it will take time, but the payoff is worth it.

		<h2>How Do You Work With Other Classes?</h2>
		<p>
		As a Warrior, you have great synergy with all three healers, as you gain skills that naturally increase your health, and healing amount. While you lack defense increasing abilties compared to the other two, you help your DPS players tear down enemies a lot faster than the other two. You can last long in a fight through sheer power of damage, or through healing of your own accord.
