		In an age long past, when mankind flourished under the radiance of arcane mastery, the island of Vylbrand was home to a city-state called Nym. Though the history of that age tells of countless wars waged with earth-shattering incantations, it was the brilliant strategic maneuvering of Nym's scholars that allowed their mundane army of mariners to throw back would-be conquerers time and again. These learned men and women defended the freedom of their tiny nation with their unique command over spell-weaving faeries, utilizing the creatures' magicks to heal the wounded and bolster the strength of their allies. 
		Scholar is a new job in FFXIV: A Realm Reborn and very little is known about it as of yet. It is known that Scholar will have a Fairy pet and be more towards healing. Stay tuned for more details on abilities, traits, materia and equipment.
		</p>
		<p>
		Scholar is technically; a hybrid of a healing class and a DPS class, constantly shifting between doing damaging magic spells, and using life saving heals and shields on party members while an adorable Fearie is assisting on the side. (Or getting hit and taking the enemy hits for you after your tank dies.) Players picking up this class will
		find themselves constantly going in between healing, and damage dealing to be the msot effective. One the brightside, at least you have two Fearies you may summon to assist you right?

		So, you want to be a healer? Well, are you prepared to have a large responsibility on your shoulders? Being a heale ris no easy job. At times, it's like being that one baby sitter watching over 4 or 8 kids, constantly trying to keep them ot of danger. 
		As a healer, you are the heart of the party, as well asthe cente rof everyone's hatred or praise. You will run into many angry, or mean people, and sometimes you will run into many appreciative people. Your job is a tough one, not only because you must constantly multi task healing and doing damage, but you also have to make sure the players in your party are going to make it to the end of your content run.
		Things do not always go well, but when you manage to turn thigns around, and lead your team to victory, you will relish in the feeling.</p>

		<h2>How Do You Work With Other Classes?</h2>
		<p>You, as a Scholar, resonate quite well with your party in every way. You can make up for the lack of damage in a teammate, or provide the sustain encessary for your team to clear content. You have a variety of area based healing and shielding at your disposal, and work wonderfully as a support unit.
		Many of your secondary abilties allow you to make thigns easier for your team, whether it is restoring your own Magic bar for spells, or by increasing healing done in general, to even making an enemy take extra damage for a few moments, you're the one healing class ready for everything.</p>
