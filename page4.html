		<p>
		Hailing from the war-torn lands of the Far East, the secret arts of the ninja were born of necessity, and have since given rise to a unique breed of highly-trained combatants. 

		Able to manipulate the vital energies of the land, the air, and living beings, they manifest their power through the weaving of signs, unleashing a wide array of attacks against their foes. Master the arts of the ninja and learn to bend the tide of battle to your will. 

		Ninja was added in patch 2.4 of FFXIV: ARR along with its class Rogue.</p>
		<p>
		Ninja is a speedy, burst DPS class, able to perform short spurt sof high damages in between small epriods of time. As a Ninja, you have a variety of party utility skills as well as strong area damage presence and even stronger single target damage. You are a much saought after class by highly experienced players due to what you bring to the field. 
		But beware, your combos are very complciated and it takes time and paractice to be highly effective compared to the other DPS classes.

		<h2>So You Want To DPS?</h2>

		So you want to be a DPS? Well, do you like dealing damage? Do you like knives? do you like high numbers? Fighting Giant bug warlords, and finally: do you like studying the blade? Then Ninja (as well as DPS in general) is for you.
		As a DPS your job is to deal damae and get you guys through the content you've signed up for. You are to stay out of harms way while your tank is taking shots to the face and the healer is praying down your backs to keep death from grabbing at your ankles.
		It is up to you to do almsot nothing but high damage, but as a ninja you do have the partial responsibility to help your tank out by giving him your enemy aggro and making enemies weaker to certain damage types. If that doesn't sound cool enough already;
		you're the only one who can turn invisible.

		<h2>How Do You Work With Other Classes?</h2>
		<p>You, as the ninja of your party, work quite well with Warrior and Dark Knight. You have the ability to make enemies weak to the damage type that you, Samurai, Warrior, and Dark Knight specialize in, making you a great asset to a part group involving them. You also work well with Astrologian due to the fact you can take enemy aggro from them, and beenfit the most from their speed and damage buffs that they are constantly throwing out.
		For DPS, besides the aforementioned Samurai, you resonate well with any of the casters due to your ability to dish out decent area damage and even greater single target damage.
