		Dark Knight is a magic damage mitigaiton Tank that offers unique gameplay through a alrge range of area damaging abilties that also lead to decent enough self sustain heals. Dark Knight players will find themselves easily taking heavy magic and physical damage wile being able to do almsot comaprable damage to Warrior, while being more defensive in nature. 
		Dark Knight is relatively easy for a Tank class, having tools that make getting into tanking pretty easy, but requires time and dedication to become useful in later content. This class is a Expansion Class: which makes it only available if you've purchased Heavensward.

		<h2>So You Want To Tank?</h2>

		<p>
		So, you wish to become a tank? What does one exactly do as the tank of the party? Well, as a tnak you will be doing two main things: Taking enemy aggro (which means to gain enemy attention, and hold on to them while your teammates attack them), and you lead the party, protecting your healer and contorlling the pace of your dungeon run.
		No matter what, you will always follow the priority of; protect the healer, and hold enemy aggro. Without you, the team's healer will attacked and unable to heal your party, and without your healer, you and your party cannot make it through the dungeon. If you're playing as the tank: you're the centerpiece of the group, especially in boss battle content, it will take time, but the payoff is worth it.

		<h2>How Do You Work With Other Classes?</h2>
		<p>
		You are a Dark Knight, you are a knight wielding a greatsword, and you not only take hits while laughing at the pitiful grunts hitting you, you deal damage slowly, but powerfully. You have great sustain in heavy group enemy pulls. You take it all with little need for a healer... for a time. But even when the going gets tough, you can just laugh as you activate one of your secondary abilties, keeping yourself going way past the point of death.
		You are one of the few classes healers love to work with, because you can not only keep yourself from taking to much damage too quickly, but you also work well at protecting your teammates through your own throwable shield. You lack real support abilties unlike Warrior or Paladin, but you mke up for it by being the one Tank that rarely needs real support unless thigns are getting very intense. You mesh well with Any and all area burst DPS classes, due to the fact your high area damage just compounds so well with their own.
